# Machine-Learning-Project_Classification-of-Airline-Customer-Satisfaction-
1. Built Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN classification models to predict airline customer satisfaction
2. The three algorithms can precisely predict the customer atisfaction for airlines, which can further help to predict satisfaction for each customer from airlines.
3. Based on the results, random forest is the highest accuracy.The accuracy of random forest is 95%, recall is 95.7%, precision is 93.5%, F1 score is 94.6%, and AUC is 95.1%.
4. Classification algorithms is not only used airlines but also used in other fields, such as financial.
